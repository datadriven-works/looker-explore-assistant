Objective: Create a system that allows users to generate Looker Classic visualizations (specifically area charts) using natural language queries. The system should translate user requests into LookML queries and then produce the corresponding Highcharts JavaScript code to render the visualization.
What are Area Charts Used For?
Area charts, also known as stacked area charts, are excellent for visualizing trends and changes over time, particularly when showcasing cumulative values or highlighting the contributions of different parts of a whole. Here's a breakdown of their common use cases:
Time Series Analysis: Area charts are ideal for visualizing how a variable changes over time. They effectively show growth, decline, seasonality, and the cumulative impact of different factors.
Stacking for Composition: Area charts are excellent for showing how different parts of a whole contribute to a total value. They are useful for visualizing sales by product category, website traffic by source, or budget allocation by department.
Trend Comparison: Area charts can be used to compare the trends of multiple variables over time. They are helpful for analyzing market share, tracking the performance of different product lines, or comparing the growth of different segments.
Visual Emphasis: The filled-in area beneath the line adds visual weight and emphasizes the overall trend or cumulative value. This makes them suitable for highlighting changes and drawing attention to overall patterns.
Important Considerations:
Data Continuity: Area charts work best with continuous data, such as time series data. They are less effective for discrete data or data with large gaps.
Stacking Order: When stacking multiple series, consider the order of the stacks. The order can influence the visual impact of the chart and should be chosen to highlight the most important information.
Color Palette: Choose a color palette that is visually appealing and facilitates easy differentiation between series. Avoid using too many colors, as this can make the chart cluttered and difficult to interpret.
Labeling: Clearly label the axes, provide a legend for multiple series, and add annotations to highlight important points or events. This will help the audience understand the chart.
NLQ Example Questions for When to Use Area Charts:
As a Looker and data visualization expert, understanding the context of a user's question is crucial in selecting the most appropriate visualization. While an area chart is versatile for showcasing trends over time, it's not always the best option.
The provided examples showcase common business scenarios where an area chart is a great choice because it effectively presents trends over time, highlights the contributions of different components, and emphasizes cumulative values. These questions often involve analyzing historical data, tracking performance, visualizing growth, or understanding the composition of a whole.
However, it's essential to consider alternative visualizations when the context demands it. For instance, if the user is interested in comparing categories, a bar chart might be more suitable. If the focus is on exploring relationships between variables, a scatterplot could be a better choice. And if the goal is to present detailed data in a structured format, a table chart might be more informative.
To determine the most appropriate visualization, carefully analyze the user's question, paying attention to the following aspects:
Type of data: Are the variables continuous or categorical? Are you looking to explore trends over time, or present detailed data?
Focus of the question: Is the user interested in cumulative values, growth over time, the contribution of different components, or relationships between variables?
Level of detail: Does the user need a high-level overview or a detailed breakdown of the data?
Communication goal: What message or insight is the user trying to convey with the visualization?
By considering these factors, you can confidently select the visualization that best aligns with the user's needs and effectively communicates the insights hidden within their data.

\Configuration Options
Examining the configuration options available for the Area Chart in Looker Classic is essential for understanding how to translate natural language into specific code. Here's a breakdown of those options, focusing on the Area Chart:
Fields:
X-Axis: This is the field that determines the horizontal axis of the area chart. This field must be a numeric or date field, typically a date field representing time.
Y-Axis: This is the field that determines the vertical axis of the area chart. This field must be a numeric field representing the value you are tracking over time.
Color: This field determines the color of the area under the line. It can be a string or numeric field, often used to represent different categories or groups.
Stacking: Area charts can be stacked to show the cumulative contribution of different components. You can choose to stack the series or not.
Filters:
Filters: These are applied to the data before it's sent to the area chart, ensuring that only the relevant data is displayed. You can use any combination of LookML-defined filters to refine the data set.
Visualization Options:
Line Style: You can customize the style of the line (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted).
Point Style: You can choose to display points on the line (e.g., circle, square).
Show Value Labels: You can choose to display the values of the data points directly on the chart.
Legend Position: You can specify the position of the legend for the chart.
Data Transformations:
LookML: Looker's query language, LookML, allows you to perform transformations on your data before it's sent to the area chart. This includes:
Calculations: Creating new fields with calculated values (e.g., average order value, profit margin).
Aggregation: Summing, averaging, or counting data based on certain dimensions (e.g., total sales by product category).
Filtering: Applying filters based on specific conditions.
Renaming: Changing the names of fields or dimensions.
Example:
Let's say you want to visualize website traffic over the past year, broken down by traffic source. You want to see the cumulative traffic from each source.
X-Axis: Order Date
Y-Axis: Website Traffic
Color: Traffic Source
You can translate this into a LookML query and then use the Area Chart configuration to create the visualization.
The Importance of Understanding Data Transformations:
LookML's ability to transform data before it reaches the area chart is critical for this natural language interface. It means you can't just focus on the area chart itself; you also need to be aware of how the data is prepared in LookML to understand how different user queries would affect the final visualization.
How to Leverage This Information for Your Natural Language Interface:
Map User Language to LookML: You need to build a system that can translate user questions like: "Show me how website traffic has changed over the past year, broken down by source, and stacked to show cumulative traffic" into the corresponding LookML query and area chart settings.
Identify Data Transformations: You'll need to understand how LookML affects the data, so you can determine which fields are available, which transformations are required, and how those transformations will affect the area chart's appearance.
Explanation of Code Snippet for Vertex AI:
This JSON we're looking at here is like a blueprint for how we want our Looker visualization to look and act. The important part is the type field set to "looker_area". This tells Vertex AI that we're working with a specific kind of chart \– a Looker area chart.
Think of it like this: Vertex AI is trying to understand your request, and giving it this blueprint helps it figure out what you're aiming for. It knows it's dealing with an area chart and not, say, a bar chart or a pie chart.
Here's why this is important:
Data Understanding: Vertex AI needs to know the type of chart to correctly process the data. An area chart visualizes trends over time, showing cumulative values, while a bar chart compares categories. Knowing this is critical.
Helpful Suggestions: Vertex AI can now offer smart suggestions tailored to area charts. It might say, "Hey, you want to see how traffic changes over time? Let's plot dates on the X-axis and traffic on the Y-axis." It also knows what LookML functions are good for calculating cumulative traffic and grouping by traffic source.
Code Generation: If you ask Vertex AI to generate code for this chart, it can use this JSON to create the right Highcharts options. It knows to use Highcharts.chart and to set the right properties for an area chart.
