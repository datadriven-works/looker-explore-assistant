const Looker_Classic_Google_Map_Chart_Visualizations = `Looker Classic Google Map Chart Visualizations
Objective: Create a system that allows users to generate Looker Classic visualizations (specifically Google Map charts) using natural language queries. The system should translate user requests into LookML queries and then produce the corresponding JavaScript code to render the visualization, leveraging Looker's built-in Google Map chart.
What are Google Map Charts Used For?
Looker's Classic Google Map chart is a table-based visualization that displays geographic data points as markers on a Google map. While not as interactive as the Google Maps API chart, it's still a powerful tool for understanding location-based trends, distribution, and patterns. It is particularly useful for:
Visualizing Location Data: The Google Map chart allows you to represent data points with markers on a map, making it easy to see where events are happening, how data is clustered, or how it is spread out geographically.
Identifying Trends by Location: You can use markers to represent sales, customer locations, inventory levels, or other data points, and then use color, size, or icons to highlight trends or patterns associated with those locations.
Comparing Locations: The Google Map chart can help you visualize and compare data between different locations, such as comparing sales figures for different regions, identifying areas with high customer concentration, or analyzing the distribution of inventory.
Data Exploration: You can use the map to explore data visually, zooming in and out, panning around the map, and clicking on markers to reveal more detailed information. This can be helpful for identifying potential areas of interest or uncovering hidden patterns.
Important Considerations:
Location Data: You need to have location data associated with your data points (e.g., latitude and longitude coordinates, addresses) to create Google Map visualizations.
Map Type: Looker's Google Map chart typically uses the Google Maps "roadmap" view.
Marker Types: You can customize the appearance of markers (e.g., color, icon, size) to represent different data points or categories.
Data Aggregation: You can aggregate data points by location (e.g., city, state, country) to visualize higher-level trends or distribution patterns.
NLQ Example Questions for When to Use Google Map Charts:
As a Looker and data visualization expert, understanding the context of a user's question is crucial in selecting the most appropriate visualization. While a Google Map chart is versatile for displaying geographic data, it's not always the best option.
The provided examples showcase common business scenarios where a Google Map chart is a great choice because it effectively presents location-based insights and facilitates geographic exploration. These questions often involve analyzing customer locations, tracking field operations, visualizing sales performance, or understanding spatial distribution patterns.
However, it's essential to consider alternative visualizations when the context demands it. For instance, if the user is interested in comparing categories, a bar chart might be more suitable. If the focus is on exploring relationships between variables, a scatterplot could be a better choice. And if the goal is to present detailed data in a structured format, a table chart might be more informative.
To determine the most appropriate visualization, carefully analyze the user's question, paying attention to the following aspects:
Type of data: Does your data have a geographic component? Is the user asking for location-based insights or comparisons between locations?
Focus of the question: Is the user interested in visualizing location data, analyzing spatial trends, exploring geographic patterns, or comparing data across regions?
Level of detail: Does the user need a high-level overview of the data or a more granular view of specific locations?
Communication goal: What message or insight is the user trying to convey with the visualization?
By considering these factors, you can confidently select the visualization that best aligns with the user's needs and effectively communicates the insights hidden within their data.

\Configuration Options
Examining the configuration options available for the Google Map Chart in Looker Classic is essential for understanding how to translate natural language into specific code. Here's a breakdown of those options, focusing on the Google Map Chart:
Fields:
Latitude: This field represents the latitude coordinate of each data point. It is usually a numeric field.
Longitude: This field represents the longitude coordinate of each data point. It is usually a numeric field.
Location: You can use a field that contains an address or location name. Looker will typically try to convert this to latitude and longitude coordinates.
Color: This field determines the color of the markers on the map. It can be a string or numeric field, often used to represent different categories or groups.
Size: This field determines the size of the markers on the map. It can be a numeric field.
Icon: This field determines the icon used for the marker. It can be a string field that maps to different icons.
Filters:
Filters: These are applied to the data before it's sent to the Google Map chart, ensuring that only the relevant data is displayed. You can use any combination of LookML-defined filters to refine the data set.
Visualization Options:
Map Type: Looker's Google Map chart typically uses the Google Maps "roadmap" view. You can't change the map type using the UI.
Zoom Level: You can set the initial zoom level of the map.
Center: You can set the initial center point of the map.
Marker Style: You can customize the appearance of markers (e.g., color, icon, size).
Clustering: Looker's Google Map chart does not offer marker clustering.
Data Aggregation: You can aggregate data points by location to visualize higher-level trends.
Data Transformations:
LookML: Looker's query language, LookML, allows you to perform transformations on your data before it's sent to the Google Map chart. This includes:
Calculations: Creating new fields with calculated values (e.g., average order value, profit margin).
Aggregation: Summing, averaging, or counting data based on certain dimensions (e.g., total sales by city).
Filtering: Applying filters based on specific conditions.
Renaming: Changing the names of fields or dimensions.
Example:
Let's say you want to visualize the locations of your customers on a map, color-coded based on their average order value.
Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the customer's location.
Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the customer's location.
Color: Average Order Value
You can translate this into a LookML query and then use the Google Map Chart configuration to create the visualization.
The Importance of Understanding Data Transformations:
LookML's ability to transform data before it reaches the Google Map chart is critical for this natural language interface. It means you can't just focus on the Google Map chart itself; you also need to be aware of how the data is prepared in LookML to understand how different user queries would affect the final visualization.
How to Leverage This Information for Your Natural Language Interface:
Map User Language to LookML: You need to build a system that can translate user questions like: "Show me our customer locations on a map, color-coded based on their average order value" into the corresponding LookML query and Google Map chart settings.
Identify Data Transformations: You'll need to understand how LookML affects the data, so you can determine which fields are available, which transformations are required, and how those transformations will affect the Google Map chart's appearance.
Explanation of Code Snippet for Vertex AI:
This JSON we're looking at here is like a blueprint for how we want our Looker visualization to look and act. The important part is the type field set to "looker_google_map". This tells Vertex AI that we're working with a specific kind of chart \– a Looker Google Map chart.
Think of it like this: Vertex AI is trying to understand your request, and giving it this blueprint helps it figure out what you're aiming for. It knows it's dealing with a Google Map chart and not, say, a bar chart or a pie chart.
Here's why this is important:
Data Understanding: Vertex AI needs to know the type of chart to correctly process the data. A Google Map chart displays geographic data, while a bar chart compares categories. Knowing this is critical.
Helpful Suggestions: Vertex AI can now offer smart suggestions tailored to Google Map charts. It might say, "Hey, you want to see customer locations? Let's add latitude and longitude fields." It also knows what LookML functions are good for calculating average order value and for creating geo-related data points.
Code Generation: If you ask Vertex AI to generate code for this chart, it can use this JSON to create the right Highcharts options. It knows to use Highcharts.chart and to set the right properties for a Google Map chart.
