const Looker_Classic_Scatterplot_Chart_Visualizations = `Looker Classic Scatterplot Chart Visualizations
Objective: Create a system that allows users to generate Looker Classic visualizations (specifically scatterplot charts) using natural language queries. The system should translate user requests into LookML queries and then produce the corresponding Highcharts JavaScript code to render the visualization.
What are Scatterplot Charts Used For?
Scatterplot charts, also known as scatter diagrams, are powerful tools for visualizing relationships between two or more variables. They are particularly useful for exploring correlations, identifying clusters, and understanding the distribution of data points. Here's a breakdown of their common use cases:
Correlation Analysis: Scatterplots are essential for visually assessing the relationship between two continuous variables. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well, while a negative correlation indicates an inverse relationship.
Outlier Detection: Scatterplots can help to identify data points that deviate significantly from the overall trend, known as outliers. These outliers might represent errors in data entry or unique cases that require further investigation.
Cluster Analysis: Scatterplots can reveal groups or clusters of data points that share similar characteristics. This can be useful for segmenting customers, analyzing product performance, or identifying patterns in market trends.
Trend Analysis: While not as strong as line charts for time series, scatterplots can show trends by plotting data over time and observing any patterns or changes.
Comparative Analysis: Overlaying multiple data series on a single scatterplot can help visualize how different groups or variables compare to one another. This is useful for benchmarking, comparing different product lines, or analyzing market share.
Important Considerations:
Choice of Variables: Carefully select the variables you want to plot to ensure that they are relevant to the question you are trying to answer.
Data Scale: Consider the scale of the variables when plotting them on the scatterplot. If the scales are vastly different, it can be difficult to see relationships. Consider using logarithmic scales or other transformations to adjust the data.
Point Size and Color: Use point size and color to represent additional information. For example, larger points can represent higher values, and different colors can distinguish different groups.
Trend Lines: Adding trend lines to a scatterplot can help to visualize the overall relationship between the variables and identify any potential linear or non-linear trends.
Annotations: Annotations can be used to highlight specific data points or explain unusual patterns.
NLQ Example Questions for When to Use Scatterplot Charts:
As a Looker and data visualization expert, understanding the context of a user's question is crucial in selecting the most appropriate visualization. While a scatterplot chart is versatile for exploring relationships between variables, it's not always the best option.
The provided examples illustrate common business scenarios where a scatterplot chart is a great choice because it allows for the visual exploration of relationships between two or more continuous variables. These questions often involve examining correlations, identifying trends, comparing groups, or understanding the distribution of data points.
However, it's essential to consider alternative visualizations when the context demands it. For instance, if the user is interested in showcasing trends over time, a line chart might be more suitable. If the focus is on comparing categories, a bar chart could be a better choice. And if the goal is to present detailed data in a structured format, a table chart might be more informative.
To determine the most appropriate visualization, carefully analyze the user's question, paying attention to the following aspects:
Type of data: Are the variables continuous or categorical? Are you looking to explore relationships between variables, or present detailed data?
Focus of the question: Is the user interested in correlations, trends, comparisons between groups, or distributions?
Level of detail: Does the user need a high-level overview or a detailed breakdown of the data?
Communication goal: What message or insight is the user trying to convey with the visualization?
By considering these factors, you can confidently select the visualization that best aligns with the user's needs and effectively communicates the insights hidden within their data.

\Configuration Options
Examining the configuration options available for the Scatterplot Chart in Looker Classic is essential for understanding how to translate natural language into specific code. Here's a breakdown of those options, focusing on the Scatterplot Chart:
Fields:
X-Axis: This is the field that determines the horizontal axis of the scatterplot. This field must be a numeric or date field.
Y-Axis: This is the field that determines the vertical axis of the scatterplot. This field must also be a numeric or date field.
Color: This field determines the color of the data points on the scatterplot. It can be a string or numeric field.
Size: This field determines the size of the data points on the scatterplot. It can be a numeric field.
Shape: This field determines the shape of the data points on the scatterplot. It can be a string field that maps to different shapes.
Filters:
Filters: These are applied to the data before it's sent to the scatterplot, ensuring that only the relevant data is displayed. You can use any combination of LookML-defined filters to refine the data set.
Visualization Options:
Trend Lines: You can choose to display trend lines to visualize the overall relationship between the variables.
Point Style: You can customize the style of the data points (e.g., circle, square, triangle).
Show Value Labels: You can choose to display the values of the data points directly on the chart.
Legend Position: You can specify the position of the legend for the chart.
Data Transformations:
LookML: Looker's query language, LookML, allows you to perform transformations on your data before it's sent to the scatterplot. This includes:
Calculations: Creating new fields with calculated values (e.g., average order value, profit margin).
Aggregation: Summing, averaging, or counting data based on certain dimensions (e.g., total sales by product category).
Filtering: Applying filters based on specific conditions.
Renaming: Changing the names of fields or dimensions.
Example:
Let's say you want to see a scatterplot of customer lifetime value (CLTV) versus average order value (AOV). You want to color the points based on the customer's region.
X-Axis: Average Order Value (AOV)
Y-Axis: Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
Color: Region
You can translate this into a LookML query and then use the Scatterplot Chart configuration to create the visualization.
The Importance of Understanding Data Transformations:
LookML's ability to transform data before it reaches the scatterplot is critical for this natural language interface. It means you can't just focus on the scatterplot itself; you also need to be aware of how the data is prepared in LookML to understand how different user queries would affect the final visualization.
How to Leverage This Information for Your Natural Language Interface:
Map User Language to LookML: You need to build a system that can translate user questions like: "Show me how customer lifetime value is related to average order value, colored by customer region" into the corresponding LookML query and scatterplot settings.
Identify Data Transformations: You'll need to understand how LookML affects the data, so you can determine which fields are available, which transformations are required, and how those transformations will affect the scatterplot's appearance.
Explanation of Code Snippet for Vertex AI:
This JSON we're looking at here is like a blueprint for how we want our Looker visualization to look and act. The important part is the type field set to "looker_scatter". This tells Vertex AI that we're working with a specific kind of chart \– a Looker scatterplot chart.
Think of it like this: Vertex AI is trying to understand your request, and giving it this blueprint helps it figure out what you're aiming for. It knows it's dealing with a scatterplot chart and not, say, a bar chart or a pie chart.
Here's why this is important:
Data Understanding: Vertex AI needs to know the type of chart to correctly process the data. A scatterplot chart visualizes relationships between variables, while a bar chart compares categories. Knowing this is critical.
Helpful Suggestions: Vertex AI can now offer smart suggestions tailored to scatterplot charts. It might say, "Hey, you want to see how CLTV relates to AOV? Let's plot those on the X and Y axes." It also knows what LookML functions are good for calculating CLTV and AOV and for grouping by customer region.
Code Generation: If you ask Vertex AI to generate code for this chart, it can use this JSON to create the right Highcharts options. It knows to use Highcharts.chart and to set the right properties for a scatterplot chart.
