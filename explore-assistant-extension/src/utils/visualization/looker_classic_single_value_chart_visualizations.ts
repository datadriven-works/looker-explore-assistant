const Looker_Classic_Single_Value_Chart_Visualizations = `Looker Classic Single Value Chart Visualizations
Objective: Create a system that allows users to generate Looker Classic visualizations (specifically single value charts) using natural language queries. The system should translate user requests into LookML queries and then produce the corresponding JavaScript code to render the visualization.
What are Single Value Charts Used For?
Single value charts, sometimes called "single number" or "key performance indicator (KPI) cards," are simple visualizations that focus on displaying a single, important metric. They are ideal for:
Highlighting Key Metrics: Single value charts draw attention to a single piece of data that is critical for understanding performance, progress, or trends. They are often used to display KPIs, such as revenue, sales growth, customer satisfaction scores, or website traffic.
Providing Quick Insights: They are designed for quick and easy comprehension, making it easy to grasp the current status of a key metric at a glance.
Creating Dashboards and Scorecards: Single value charts are frequently used in dashboards and scorecards to present a high-level overview of key metrics and performance indicators.
Visualizing Comparisons: They can be used to compare a single value against a target, a previous period, or another benchmark. This helps to assess progress, identify trends, and highlight deviations from expectations.
Important Considerations:
Data Type: Single value charts are best suited for displaying single numeric values or simple aggregations (e.g., sums, averages). They are not ideal for displaying categorical data or complex calculations.
Formatting: Use appropriate formatting for numbers, currencies, percentages, and other data types to ensure readability and clarity.
Color and Style: Use colors and styles to enhance visual appeal and highlight important information. For example, you can use different colors to indicate positive or negative changes or highlight values that exceed or fall below a target.
Context and Labels: Provide clear labels and context to help users understand the meaning of the displayed value.
NLQ Example Questions for When to Use Single Value Charts:
As a Looker and data visualization expert, understanding the context of a user's question is crucial in selecting the most appropriate visualization. While a single value chart is versatile for highlighting key metrics, it's not always the best option.
The provided examples illustrate common business scenarios where a single value chart is a great choice because it concisely presents a single, important metric and emphasizes its value. These questions often involve displaying KPIs, tracking performance, or highlighting key data points.
However, it's essential to consider alternative visualizations when the context demands it. For instance, if the user is interested in showcasing trends over time, a line chart might be more suitable. If the focus is on comparing categories, a bar chart could be a better choice. And if the goal is to present detailed data in a structured format, a table chart might be more informative.
To determine the most appropriate visualization, carefully analyze the user's question, paying attention to the following aspects:
Type of data: Is the data a single numeric value or a simple aggregation? Is the user asking for a specific metric or a comparison between values?
Focus of the question: Is the user interested in highlighting a key metric, tracking progress, assessing performance, or comparing values?
Level of detail: Does the user need a high-level overview of a single value or a more detailed breakdown of multiple values?
Communication goal: What message or insight is the user trying to convey with the visualization?
By considering these factors, you can confidently select the visualization that best aligns with the user's needs and effectively communicates the insights hidden within their data.

\Configuration Options
Examining the configuration options available for the Single Value Chart in Looker Classic is essential for understanding how to translate natural language into specific code. Here's a breakdown of those options, focusing on the Single Value Chart:
Fields:
Value: This is the field that contains the single value you want to display. This field must be a numeric field.
Comparison: You can choose to compare the value against a target, a previous period, or another benchmark. Looker provides several comparison types (e.g., value, percentage).
Filters:
Filters: These are applied to the data before it's sent to the single value chart, ensuring that only the relevant data is displayed. You can use any combination of LookML-defined filters to refine the data set.
Visualization Options:
Single Value Title: You can add a custom title to the single value chart to provide context and clarity.
Value Format: You can apply a custom format to the displayed value (e.g., currency, percentage).
Comparison Label: You can add a custom label for the comparison value.
Conditional Formatting: You can use conditional formatting to change the color or style of the value based on specific conditions (e.g., highlight values above or below a target).
Color: You can customize the color of the single value.
Comparison Reverse Colors: You can reverse the colors used for the value and the comparison value.
Data Transformations:
LookML: Looker's query language, LookML, allows you to perform transformations on your data before it's sent to the single value chart. This includes:
Calculations: Creating new fields with calculated values (e.g., average order value, profit margin).
Aggregation: Summing, averaging, or counting data based on certain dimensions (e.g., total sales by product category).
Filtering: Applying filters based on specific conditions.
Renaming: Changing the names of fields or dimensions.
Example:
Let's say you want to display the total revenue for the current month, with a comparison to the previous month's revenue.
Value: Total Revenue for Current Month
Comparison: Total Revenue for Previous Month
You can translate this into a LookML query and then use the Single Value Chart configuration to create the visualization.
The Importance of Understanding Data Transformations:
LookML's ability to transform data before it reaches the single value chart is critical for this natural language interface. It means you can't just focus on the single value chart itself; you also need to be aware of how the data is prepared in LookML to understand how different user queries would affect the final visualization.
How to Leverage This Information for Your Natural Language Interface:
Map User Language to LookML: You need to build a system that can translate user questions like: "Show me the total revenue for this month, compared to last month's revenue" into the corresponding LookML query and single value chart settings.
Identify Data Transformations: You'll need to understand how LookML affects the data, so you can determine which fields are available, which transformations are required, and how those transformations will affect the single value chart's appearance.
Explanation of Code Snippet for Vertex AI:
This JSON we're looking at here is like a blueprint for how we want our Looker visualization to look and act. The important part is the type field set to "single_value". This tells Vertex AI that we're working with a specific kind of chart \– a Looker single value chart.
Think of it like this: Vertex AI is trying to understand your request, and giving it this blueprint helps it figure out what you're aiming for. It knows it's dealing with a single value chart and not, say, a bar chart or a pie chart.
Here's why this is important:
Data Understanding: Vertex AI needs to know the type of chart to correctly process the data. A single value chart displays a single metric, while a bar chart compares categories. Knowing this is critical.
Helpful Suggestions: Vertex AI can now offer smart suggestions tailored to single value charts. It might say, "Hey, you want to show total revenue? Let's add a field for total revenue." It also knows what LookML functions are good for calculating total revenue and for setting up comparisons.
Code Generation: If you ask Vertex AI to generate code for this chart, it can use this JSON to create the right Highcharts options. It knows to use Highcharts.chart and to set the right properties for a single value chart.
